# Diamond Prompt Runner

Diamond Prompt Runner is a local-first desktop workspace for authoring, rendering, executing, and organizing AI prompt workflows on disk.

## Repository

GitHub: <https://github.com/blossomz37/diamond-prompt-runner>

## Current Direction

- Product spec: `specifications/SPEC_DIAMOND_RUNNER_v1.md`
- Approved prototype: `Diamond Runner v2 - IDE Pass`
- App direction: Tauri + Svelte desktop app with an IDE-like shell
- Current implementation milestone: create or open a local project, browse the project tree, open supported assets in read-only tabs, and inspect metadata
- OpenRouter integration is deferred to the later execution slice; milestone 1 does not include provider calls, API-key storage, or SDK wiring

## Recommended Agent Setup

Recommended plugins and tool surfaces for this repo:
- Figma for prototype iteration and later design-to-code work
- GitHub for commit, PR, release, and publish workflows
- Svelte docs and Context7 for implementation guidance
- Playwright for UI smoke tests and regression checks once the app shell exists
- Notion only if planning or spec material for this project is kept there

Recommended custom-instruction themes:
- treat `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `specifications/SPEC_DIAMOND_RUNNER_v1.md` as authority
- keep Diamond file-first
- prefer vertical slices over screen-by-screen implementation
- treat `workshop-parts/` as reference material, not runtime truth
- keep local commits milestone-based and pushes explicit

See `implementation-plans/04-PLAN-agent-tooling-and-workflows.md` for the detailed tooling audit and workflow guidance.
